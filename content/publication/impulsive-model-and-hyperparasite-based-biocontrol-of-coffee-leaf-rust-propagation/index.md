abstract: Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages in the world. Its
  cultivation is an important factor of social and economic stability. However,
  its production is affected by several diseases. Coffee leaf rust (CLR), a
  cryptogamic disease caused by the fungus Hemileia vastatrix, is the most
  serious coffee leaf disease known to date. It causes damages that induce
  severe yield losses. Its control mainly relies on good cultural practices,
  fungicides, resistant cultivars and biocontrol using hyperparasites (such as
  the fungus Lecanicillium lecanii). Fungicides are widely used, but have a
  harmful ecological impact. Coffee being a perennial plant, planting resistant
  cultivars implies to renew the plantation, which is very costly.
  Hyperparasites could hence be a good alternative, but careful analysis is
  needed for their deployment to be successful in the long term. Our goal is to
  understand and control the propagation of CLR, deploying hyperparasites.
  Depending on the country and climate, coffee trees produce berries throughout
  the year or seasonally. We consider the latter case, with a periodic coffee
  harvest at the end of the rainy season and limited growth during the dry
  season. Therefore, we developed an impulsive model to describe CLR propagation
  in the coffee plantation during the rainy season and its survival between
  rainy seasons. Floquet theory is used to prove the stability of the periodic
  disease free solution and numerical simulations are performed to illustrate
  theoretical results. To implement biological control, new discontinuities are
  introduced in the model to represent the release of hyperparasites. Floquet
  theory and numerical simulations are then combined to determine parameter
  values for which the periodic disease free solution is stable and which
  correspond to successful biocontrol deployment.
