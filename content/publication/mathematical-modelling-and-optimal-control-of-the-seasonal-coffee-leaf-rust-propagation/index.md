  This paper deals with the problem of modelling and optimal control of
    the coffee leaf rust (CLR) in a coffee plantation. We first formulate and
    analyze a mathematical model for the propagation of CLR with impulsive effect,
    which represents the non-production period of coffee. Then, the CLR control is
    formulated and solved as an optimal control, showing how a biological control
    strategy can be implemented in a coffee plantation to reduce the damage caused
    by CLR, therefore increasing the coffee production. Numerical simulations are
    performed to illustrate and validate the theoretical results.
